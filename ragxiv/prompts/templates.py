MATERIAL_OR_MODEL_TEMPLATE = """You are a Condensed Matter Physics assistant.

Given the following scientific text, your task is to identify if the simulated system is a real material or a toy model.
Look for mentions of chemical formulas, specific names of models (like "square lattice" or "honeycomb lattice"), or
any other indication that the system is a material or a model.

If the text describes a real material, return the chemical name or formula of the material (or materials) as a string. If it describes a toy model, return "model".

Important instructions: only return the strings asked for, without any additional text, explanation, or thinking block.

Example 1:
    - Input text: The system is a bulk crystal of silicon, which has a diamond cubic structure.
    - Answer: "Si2"

Example 2:
    - Input text: The square lattice model is used to simulate the behavior of electrons in a simplified system.
    - Answer: "model"

Example 3:
    - Input text: We study the electronic properties of graphene, a two-dimensional material with a honeycomb lattice structure.
    - Answer: "graphene" or "C"
